## NIE-PDL'24. Lecture 9. Deep Learning project design

This repo is a fork of [H2O LLM Studio](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-llmstudio).

It's a slim version of H2O LLM Studio that serves as a template for a Deep Learning project. It's just a template, and might not be runnable as is. Moreover, `llm_studio/train.py` contains a set of bugs that need to be fixed. These bugs are related only to `train.py` file, and there is no need to fix other files.

Your goal is to find bugs in `train.py` and create GitHub issues with a bug description and a proposed fix. Each bug found is worth 1 point into your final grade. There should be about 10 bugs we are aware of.
